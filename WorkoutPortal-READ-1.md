<h1>About Workout Portals</h1>

My projects is an app that lets a user create a workout by listing their exercises.  It gives a user the ability to record data by adding a exercise name, the amount of sets for a given exercise, and the amount of sets or times someone will repeat an exercise. Each user has their own individual profile where they have the ability to create, edit, or destroy their own individual exercises.

<h1>Technologies Used</h1>

<ul>
<li>React</li>
<li>Node</li>
<li>Express</li>
<li>MongoDB</li>
<li>Millagram</li>
<li>Postman</li>
<li>HTML & CSS</li>

<h1>Approach Taken</h1>

 I started with figuring out my User and Exercise models. I then used node and express to create the framework of project starting with the user model by staring with the sign-up and login form for the user.  After that I generated the exercises and along with making sure that I created the Restful routes.  When it came to the CRUD portion of the app, I started with creating an exercise, then giving a user the ability to delete an exercise.  After that the hardest part was getting the user to have the ability to edit and exercise. 

<h1>Installation/startup instructions</h1>

How can a potential employer run your code locally on their own machine?

<li>Have nodemon and Mongod running in the terminal.<li>

Run NPM start

<h1>Challenges</h1>
Although; I figured out how to allow a user to create, edit, and destroy a meal. I was not able to finish getting the user to delete or edit their infromation, which would be the next steps to upgrading the app into a nicer layout for it's users.
